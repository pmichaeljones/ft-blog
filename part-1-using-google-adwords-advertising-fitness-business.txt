SEO Title: Part 1: How to Make Google Adwords Work for Your Fitness Business
Meta-D: Having managed over $100,000 per month in AdWords, Patrick Jones will gives suggestions on how to use AdWords at your fitness business.

My name is Patrick Jones, and I'm the owner of Boost Fitness Marketing. Prior to starting this company, I worked in search engine marketing for a large Denver startup. Along with my manager, I co-managed an AdWords budget of over $100,000 per month. That means we were spending close to $3000 per day on Google advertising. I learned a LOT during my time with that startup. Now that FitnessTexter takes up my days, I thought I'd put together a guide for fitness centers looking to use Google AdWords. Here goes!

**Start disclaimer ***
FitnessTexter does not provide Google Adwords services. If you're looking for search engine marketing help, just search, "search engine marketing _________", with the blank being your city name. And a word of warning. There are a LOT of untrustworthy SEM(search engine marketing) companies out there. It's best to get a referral from someone you know who uses the same company.

This is going to be an extremely long post, cut into multiple parts. First, I'll discuss HOW Google AdWords works. This will give you a better idea of how to make your internet marketing campaign more successful.

First and foremost, let's go over all the acronyms that I'll be using throuhout this post. The internet is full of acronyms and internet marketing is no different. Most of the acronyms search their purpose, they shorten long phrases and don't have much meaning besides their letters. This is very unlike US government backronyms; things like the PATRIOT Act. Someone's job was to create a phrase that could be shortened into PATRIOT. Stupid! Anyways, enough ranting, onto the good stuff.

Google AdWords is a form of advertising called pay-per-click(PPC). It's a facet of search engine marketing(SEM). Within SEM, you'll also find search engine optimization(SEO). SEO is all about getting your business to show up high in the search engine results page(SERP).
