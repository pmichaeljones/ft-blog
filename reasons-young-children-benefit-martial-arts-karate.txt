SEO Title: 5 Reasons Parents Should Sign Their Children Up for Martial Arts
Meta-D: Social interaction, conflict resolution, and stress relief are just a few of the reasons that parents should sign their children up for a martial arts or karate class.

<h2>Learn and Practice Conflict Resolution Tactics</h2>


<h2>Build Strong Youth Friendships</h2>


<h2>Give Healthy Way to Release Stress & Energy</h2>


<h2>Instill Self-Confidence and Build Self-Esteem</h2>


<h2>Learn to Respect Authoritarian Figures</h2>

<p>One thing that all parents are sure to agree on is that their children need to show respect to the parents themselves, as well
as their elders and authority figures; even to humanity in general. Some parents enjoy teaching their children these lessons directly, while others would their children to learn then in school or out in the real world. Either works.</p>

<p>If there's one teaching figure who will teach respect to children, it's a martial arts teacher. They themselves were taught to respect their own master whil in training and will happily instill that same sense of respect on your own children. Young martial arts students are taught to respect their opponents, as well as their master. They're taught to be kind and listen to other's opinions. These are all great values that carry over into everyday life.</p>
