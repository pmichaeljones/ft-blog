Post-Title: Why CrossFit Friends are Friends Forever
SEO Title: The Reason CrossFit Builds Strong Friendships
Meta-D: We're all aware that people who do CrossFit hang out with other people who do CrossFit. Why are these friendships so strong you ask? Here's why.

Have you ever wondered why people who do CrossFit are so excited to talk about CrossFit? It's because they love it! Think about something that you really enjoy doing, be it working out, biking, knitting, you name it. Now imagine that someone asked you about this hobby. Would you begrudgingly tell them about it, or would you enthusiastically tell them every minute detail. Of course you'd tell them every detail! Well, that's what it's like doing CrossFit.

The question is, why does CrossFit create such strong friendships? Though we're not scientists, here's why we think CrossFit forms such strong friendships.

<h2>Stressful Situations Build Strong Bonds</h2>
Did you ever go to summer camp as a child? If so, do you still remember some of the kids you met? If you answered "Yes" to the first question, there's a good chance you also answered "Yes" to the second question. The reason being, stressful situations help form strong bonds. We're in no way comparing military experience to summer camp, but it's very well known that the friends you make during stressful military deployments tend to stay friends for life. Summer camp is a VERY stressful experience for young children. They're out of their comfort zone and they're encouraged to participate in events with kids they don't know. Without a doubt, they tend to become good friends with these kids, because they had a shared experience together.

Have you ever done a CrossFit workout? If so, you're well aware that they're physically and mentally demanding. However, you're doing them aloneside other people who are encouraging you along. When the workout is over, you can happily make sweat angels on the floor with your new friends, reminiscing about the difficulty of the last WOD.
